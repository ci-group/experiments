# Computational Intelligence Experiments
You can use this repository to save your research code, for example when you want to refer to it for one of your papers.
Create a branch and put your project in a directory.
Please put your name in the branch so it easy to clean up stale branches, e.g.: `aart_some_research_topic`. If you want you can merge back your experiment to the main branch when you are done.
